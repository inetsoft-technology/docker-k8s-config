[[overview]]
== Overview

The details of every production deployment are unique to the hosting Kubernetes cluster and the requirements for that deployment. As such, it is difficult to provide detailed instructions that match your needs. You are strongly encouraged to contact InetSoft support to determine the best way to design your deployment. This document provides general guidelines about the requirements for a production deployment.

[[shared-storage]]
== Shared Storage

The shared configuration volume, `/var/lib/inetsoft/shared` must be mounted to persistent storage that is shared by all pods. The recommended storage type is listed in the following table.

|===
|Kubernetes Provider |Storage Type

|Bare metal
|Network storage, such as https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/#nfs[NFS]

|Amazon EKS
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/efs-csi.html[EFS]

|Google GKE
|https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/persistent-volumes#storageclasses[Filestore]

|Azure AKS
|https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-storage#storage-classes[Managed Disk or Azure File Share]

== Materialized View Storage

Materialized views require fast access to the block files stored in the `/var/lib/inetsoft/local/bs` volume. The recommended storage type is listed in the following table.

|===
|Kubernetes Provider |Storage Type

|Bare metal
|A distributed, replicated file system that is local to each node, such as https://rook.io/docs/rook/v1.7/[Rook Ceph]

|Amazon EKS
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/ebs-csi.html[EBS]

|Google GKE
|https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/persistent-volumes#storageclasses[Default (ext4)]

|Azure AKS
|https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-storage#storage-classes[Managed Disk]

[[oak-storage]]
== Asset Storage

The InetSoft application contains two storage types. The 'Key-Value Storage Type' and the 'Blob Storage Type'. The ‘Key-Value Storage Type’ determines the method of storage for key-value settings, such as server properties. The default is MapDB. The ‘Blob Storage Type’ determines the method of storage for binary objects, such as Dashboards. The default is shared file system.

The table below provide examples of common storage configurations.


|===
|Storage provider |Key-Value Storage Type |Blob Storage Type

|Default
|The default configuration has MapDB as key-value storage.
|The default configuration uses a shared file system (NFS/Samba/CIFS) blob engine.

|AWS
|https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/[DynamoDB]
|https://aws.amazon.com/s3/[S3]. Note, the S3 blob engine can be used with any S3-compatible object storage, i.e. a self-hosted MinIO installation or Ceph.
