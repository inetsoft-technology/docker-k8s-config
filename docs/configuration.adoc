[[overview]]
== Overview

Container environment variables and an external source of configuration files and scripts are used to configure the containers.

NOTE: All configuration is done on the initialization containers. The only exception is the `INETSOFT_MASTER_PASSWORD` environment variable, which should be set on the initialization, scheduler, and server containers.

[[external-config]]
== External Configuration

External configuration can be supplied by mounting an external volume containing the configuration at `/var/lib/inetsoft/external`, or by setting environment variables that control where the configuration is copied from.

The external configuration can be copied from a Git repository or any location supported by https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-vfs/filesystems.html[Apache Commons VFS].

The environment variables specifying the location are as follows:

|===
| Variable | Description

| `INETSOFT_CONFIG_URL`
| The URL of the configuration.

| `INETSOFT_CONFIG_USERNAME`
| The username for the configuration URL.

| `INETSOFT_CONFIG_PASSWORD`
| The password for the configuration URL.

| `INETSOFT_CONFIG_KEYFILE`
| The location of the SSH key file. If specified, `INETSOFT_CONFIG_PASSWORD` should be the password for the key file, if required.

| `INETSOFT_CONFIG_BRANCH`
| The branch or tag if using the Git repository.

| `INETSOFT_CONFIG_PATH`
| The path, relative to the URL, containing the configuration. If not specified, the URL will be used as the base of the configuration.

| `INETSOFT_CONFIG_SFTP_USEROOTDIR`
| If `true`, use the root directory instead of the user's home directory when using SFTP. By default, the user's home directory will be used.
|===

The URL for Git repositories should be prefixed with `git://`, for example, `git://http://host/...`, `git://https://host/...`, or `git://ssh://user@host:/...`.

The URL may be for a directory containing the external configuration or an archive file containing the external configuration. Any archive file format supported by https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-compress/[Apache Commons Compress] may be used, including GZIPed archives of supported formats (e.g. `*.tar.gz`).

HTTP and HTTPS do not support directory listing, so if using one of these protocols, it _must_ be for an archive file.

If you are mounting the external configuration to the `/var/lib/inetsoft/external` volume, the URL should be set to `file:///var/lib/inetsoft/external`. The `file:` protocol should not be used otherwise.

The external configuration may contain the following directories:

|===
| Directory | Description

| `assets/`
| Asset ZIP files that will be imported into the repository.

| `config/`
| Files to be placed in the data space. It may include an `asset.dat.d` directory containing assets. This is essentially a local `sree.home` directory.


| `lib/`
| Additional JAR files that should be added to the application class path.

| `plugins/`
| Additional plugins and JDBC drivers.

| `scripts/`
| Additional or overridden initialization scripts.
|===

An example of an external configuration can be found in the `config/`
directory of this repository.

[[scripts]]
=== Initialization Scripts

Initialization scripts are shell (`.sh`) or Groovy (`.groovy`) scripts that are named using a convention that will ensure the order of their execution. For example, `00-start.sh` would be executed first and `99-finish.groovy` would be executed last.

The builtin script that copies the files from the staging directory to the shared directory is named `50-stage-type.groovy`. That way, any scripts that should be executed before files are deployed into the data space should be less than 50 and any scripts that should be executed after they are deployed should be greater than 50. Groovy scripts should not call `connect` unless they are greater than 50.

The following script levels are reserved by pre-defined scripts:

* `00` - initializes the base properties and passwords.
* `49` - stages the shared files that are outside the data space, e.g. plugins and drivers.
* `50` - installs files from staging into the data space.
* `51` - re-encrypts the admin password to ensure FIPS compliance.
* `75` - imports all assets from `staging/assets` into the data space.

This convention allows external configurations to customize the configuration during various phases of the initialization process. For example, a script named `01-remove-extras.sh` could delete unwanted drivers or plugins from the staging directory. A script named `76-set-passwords.groovy` could change the username and password of a data source.

=== inetsoft.yaml Configuration

The configuration of the storage back end is done in inetsoft.yaml. This file contains the key-value and blob store configuration as well as the audit database configuration, the Hazelcast cluster configuration, as well a couple of other top-level initialization settings.

===== Shared Configuration
All configuration files share the following configuration settings, regardless of the storage implementation. These settings can be directly mapped to those in the legacy dbProp.properties file.

.inetsoft.yaml

fipsComplianceMode: false
----
===== Cluster Configuration
Clusters *cannot* use the MapDB key-value storage or the local filesystem for blob storage. They should configure the cluster.quorumMembers property in inetsoft.yaml.

The quorum members contain the identifiers of the server and scheduler instances that are members of the cluster quorum. For any node in the cluster, at least (n / 2) + 1 quorum members must be visible to a node in order for that node to make any persistent changes. This prevents inconsistencies from being introduced during a split-brain condition due to network partitioning. The quorum member identifier for a server or scheduler instance is set by using the inetsoft.cluster.quorumMemberId system property when starting the instance.

For statically provisioned clusters, all server and scheduler nodes should be included in the quorum.

For elastic clusters, the "base" server and scheduler nodes should be included in the quorum. For example, if the minimum number of server nodes is configured to be 3 in a Kubernetes stateful set, the hostnames of the first three server pods and the hostnames for all the scheduler nodes should be included in the quorum. During normal operation these pods will always be running and provide a consistent cluster quorum.

For example, a statically provisioned cluster with 3 server instances and 1 scheduler instance should be configured using:

.inetsoft.yaml
[source,yaml]
cluster:
  quorumMembers:
    - server1
    - server2
    - server3
    - scheduler

The instances would be started with the following command line options, respectively:

[source]
-Dinetsoft.cluster.quorumMemberId=server1
-Dinetsoft.cluster.quorumMemberId=server2
-Dinetsoft.cluster.quorumMemberId=server3
-Dinetsoft.cluster.quorumMemberId=scheduler

A Kubernetes deployment with a minimum number of 3 server pods, 1 scheduler pod and the name of the server stateful set server in the namespace inetsoft would use the configuration:

.inetsoft.yaml
[source,yaml]
cluster:
  quorumMembers:
    - server-0.inetsoft.svc.cluster.local
    - server-1.inetsoft.svc.cluster.local
    - server-2.inetsoft.svc.cluster.local
    - scheduler

The server pods would have the following command line option:
[source]
-Dinetsoft.cluster.quorumMemberId=$(hostname)

The scheduler pod would have the following command line option:
[source]
-Dinetsoft.cluster.quorumMemberId=scheduler

==== Configure Asset Storage
By default, inetsoft.yaml is configured using an H2 database and a shared filesystem blob store. If you want to use a different storage system, you'll need to include a custom `config/inetsoft.yaml` file in your external configuration.

The inetsoft.yaml asset storage configuration has the following structure shown below.

*NOTE:*  The below is an example of multiple configurations. The actual inetsoft.yaml used in a deployment should only contain *one* of the configurations.
